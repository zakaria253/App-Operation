Software Engineering 1 Code of Conduct
Group Members:
Zakaria Manyani (MAN22525381)
Mohamed Benchekroun Krimi (KRI22528198)

Attendance and Participation
Members of the team are expected to attend all scheduled meetings, occuring twice a week, on Fridays at 2pm, and on Tuesdays, at 10am. If a member is unable to attend, notify the other group members at least two hours prior to the meeting. Refer to consequences to read about what happens if this is not met.

Discrimination and Harassment
No member in the group should be made to feel lower than any other member, and all members should feel safe, regardless of:

Background
Family status
Gender
Gender identity or expression
Marital status
Sex
Sexual orientation
Native language
Age
Ability
Race and/or ethnicity
Caste
National origin
Socioeconomic status
Religion
Geographic location
Plagarism
All work contributed by members must be original work, and citations/references must be shown where external sources are used. We do not want to risk the integrity of our work based on the actions of a sole individual. Finding if work is plagarised will immediately become a third-degree consequence, and may be investigated further.

Job Duties
All members are expected to complete their assigned tasks, given to them in the meetings, and these must be completed to the best of the members' abilities.
Effective communication is needed, and where a member may feel that they are unable to complete a task, or require assistance, they must reach out to the other members of the group, notifying them.
A failure to keep job duties may result in reassignment of tasks, or action may be taken. Refer to consequences for actions.
Expected Behaivour
Respect
All members should be treated with respect and kindness. Disagreements are bound to happen eventually, but we are all working toward the same goal.

Confidentiality
Respect the confidentiality of group discussions, plans, and work created and shared within the group. They are not to be shared with other groups.

Directness
Criticism is necessary in order to improve, and we must be able to speak directly, though this does not mean a member must be unnecessarily harsh to another member. Honesty and directness is needed, but so is respectfulness.

Future Modifications to Guidelines
There may be changes made to this code of conduct, and all group members will be notified before and after a change is made, ensuring that there is no excuse to not be updated with the current code of conduct. These changes will also be brought up within group meetings.

Consequences:
All offences will be logged.

First offence: a verbal warning will be issued
Second offence: offender must buy all other group members coffee
Third offence: offender must write a written apology
Continued offences may risk in a member being removed from the group, and may require notifying senior staff members.

Conclusion
By participating in this group, each member understands that they will follow this code of conduct, so that we can build a positive and productive environment, where all members feel valued and respected. If a member has any questions, ask through whatever available mediums there are.
